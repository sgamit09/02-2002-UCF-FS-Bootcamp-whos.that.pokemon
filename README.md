# Who's that Pokemon Javascript Quiz

This homework assignment applies what we learned in Javascript mainly. It also combines Javascript with our knowledge and experience with HTML & CSS. I created a "Who's That Pokemon?!" Quiz. Instead of CSS, I used what we learned regarding Bootstrap 5.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code, GitBash, & Google Chrome

## Deployment

To begin the quiz, you will need to click on the start button shown in the screenshot below.

Then the quiz will test your knowledge of Pokemon and possibly meme culture. The code used functions, eventListeners, and HTML DOM traversal to get the code running and showing up on the browser. Once the code is complete, you will be prompted to input your initals to record your score. A highscore tab will open and you will be able to see your score and others as well. Below is a screenshot of the highscore page.
